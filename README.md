# Predicting-Movie-Reviews-Sentiment

To predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews, I used three different models:
- Bag of Centroids with Random Forest
- Bag of Words with Tensorflow
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with Tensorflow

The data for this project was from a Kaggle competition in 2015: https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial. Despite the two years having passed, it was still an excellent learning tool for my first Natural Language Processing project. Having the ability to compare my results to others provided a good benchmark and motivation to improve my code, as well as having a tutorial to learn from and build off of.
